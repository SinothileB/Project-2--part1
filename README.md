A summary with at least 2 recommendations for your stakeholders, based on your model performance AND analytical findings.
 - 	I recommend that the stakeholders provide balanced data so that the models can be more accurate
 - 	The stakeholders must know that there will still be few errors with this model since the data was not balanced , we still have Few False predictions
